/*
 * Interface for a cognition model.
 *
 * In the cognition phase, agent make decision based on their perception.
 * Basically, any choice model like for example route choice models could be implemented here.
 *
 * A cognition model decides to which {@link SelfCategory} a {@link Pedestrian}
 * identifies to. From this {@link SelfCategory} a specific behavior derives.
 * E.g. if {@Link SelfCategory} = {@link SelfCategory#COOPERATIVE}, pedestrians
 * can swap places.
 *
 *
 * It is designed as an interface so that different models can be used for
 * different scenarios (by specifying in the JSON file).
 *
 * The <code>initialize</code> method must be called before usage!
 * This interface defines callbacks for the simulation loop.
 * It's implementations define the major part of the simulation model's logic.
 *
 * This approach is similar to the {@link Model} interface for locomotion models.
 *
 * Watch out: The perception phase should be finished before using
 * methods in this class because, usually, first a stimulus is processed and
 * then pedestrians decide which behavior to follow. E.g., first a {@link Threat}
 * is recognized and then a pedestrian decides to follow a
 * {@link SelfCategory#THREATENED} behavior.
