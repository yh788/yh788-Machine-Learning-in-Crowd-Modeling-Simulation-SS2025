# TUM Robotics and AI Master's Project

## Course: Machine Learning in Crowd Modeling Simulation
### Semester: Summer Semester 2025

This repository contains the code and project files for the **"Machine Learning in Crowd Modeling Simulation"** course, undertaken as part of my Master's studies in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). The content covers exercises from EX1 to EX5, as well as the final project.

### Project Overview

This course explores the methods for modeling and analyzing **crowd dynamics**, and their applications in various scenarios. The projects range from fundamental mathematical modeling to advanced machine learning techniques, with the goal of understanding and predicting crowd behavior through simulation and data analysis.

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized by course exercise number. Each folder corresponds to a specific task, making it easy to navigate and review the work.

-   **`EX1_Modeling_of_Crowds`**:
    * **Contents**: Code for developing mathematical models of crowd behavior, involving differential agent-based modeling.

-   **`EX2_Simulation_Software`**:
    * **Contents**: Building simulation based on the models from EX1, using Vadere as simulation software.

-   **`EX3_Representation_of_data`**:
    * **Contents**: Exploring effective ways to represent and process the large datasets generated from crowd simulations, using PCA, Diffusion Maps, etc.

-   **`EX4_Bifurcation_and_Visualization`**:
    * **Contents**: Analyzing system parameters for bifurcation points to study sudden changes in system behavior.

-   **`EX5_Learning_Dynamical_Systems`**:
    * **Contents**: Applying linear or RBF approximators to learn from data and predict the behavior of dynamical systems, serving as an advanced approach to crowd behavior prediction.

-   **`Final_Project`**:
    * **Contents**: "Prediction of Pedestrian Speed through Artificial Neural Network". In the project, we replicated the result of a academical paper, and compared our result to it.
